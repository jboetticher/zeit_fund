Zeit Fund should:
- Give a single account the ability to use a smart contract to buy/redeem shares in ZTG
- Force the single account to have at least X amount of ZTG to do anything
- Allow users to buy shares of the smart contract
- Allow users to redeem shares of the smart contract


NOTE:
No dynamic insert of funds. There is a period where funds are added and afterwards no more.
Users cannot force liquidation.
Users that wish to exit can only resell the ERC20 token, not liquidate for the individual market positions.
